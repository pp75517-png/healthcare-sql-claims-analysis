## US Healthcare Claims & Denial Analysis using SQL

### Overview
This project simulates a real-world US healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) scenario using a synthetic but industry-aligned dataset. The goal is to analyze claim performance, denial patterns, and revenue leakage using SQL.

### Database Structure
- patients: patient demographics
- claims: insurance claim details
- denials: denied claims and reasons

### Key SQL Concepts Used
- CREATE DATABASE & TABLE
- INSERT statements
- WHERE filtering
- GROUP BY aggregations
- INNER & LEFT JOINs
- Revenue and denial rate calculations

### Key Insights Generated
- Total denied revenue
- Denial rate across claims
- Denials by reason and amount
- Patient-level denial analysis

### Disclaimer
This project uses synthetic data designed to resemble US healthcare claims for educational and portfolio purposes. No real patient data is used.
